<h2>JavaScript: Consuming and Handling Data from an API</h2>
<p>
This application is a dynamic form that consumes the ViaCEP API to fetch and display address information based on the entered postal code.<br />
  
In this course, I learned the following:

  • Understand how asynchronous JavaScript works.<br />
  • Consume the ViaCEP API using the Fetch API.<br />
  • Learn about Promises and their methods.<br />
  • Utilize async/await to create asynchronous functions.<br />
  • Handle potential request errors returned by the API.<br />
  • Transform a static form page into a dynamic one.<br />
  
• Total duration of the course: 6h.<br />

<h1>🏠 Integrated Address Verification 🏠</h1>
<p>
Integrated Address Verification is a JavaScript application that allows users to consume and handle data from the ViaCEP API.<br />
It provides an interface for users to enter a Brazilian ZIP code (CEP) and retrieve the corresponding address details.<br /><br />
</p>

<h3>:rocket: Getting Started</h3>
<p>
To get started with Integrated Address Verification, follow these steps:

    1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project files.
    2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
    3. Ensure you have a modern web browser installed.
    4. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
</p>

<h3>:hammer: Project structure</h3>
<p>
The project's structure is organized as follows:

├── img/<br />
│   │   ├── Logo.svg<br />
│   │   └── ...<br />
├── styles/<br />
│   │   ├── styles.css<br />
│   │   └── ...<br />
├── cadastro-finalizado.html<br />
├── index.html<br />
├── README.md<br />
└── script.js<br />

    • img/: This directory contains the images used in the project.
    • styles/: This directory contains the CSS files for styling the project.
    • cadastro-finalizado.html: This file represents the HTML page displayed when the user completes a registration.
    • index.html: This file is the main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the project.
    • script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for implementing the project's functionality, such as form validation and interactivity.
</p>

<h3>💻 Usage</h3>
<p>
  To use the Integrated Address Verification application, follow the steps below:<br />
  
    1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
    2. Fill out the address form by entering the required information such as ZIP code, street address, neighborhood, city, and state.
    3. As you type or after entering the ZIP code, the application will automatically retrieve and populate the remaining address fields using the ViaCEP API.
    4. If any errors occur during the API request or if the entered ZIP code is invalid, an error message will be displayed.
    5. Make sure to double-check the populated address fields for accuracy.
    6. Submit the form to save the entered address data or perform any additional actions as required by your application.

<h3>🌐 ViaCEP API</h3>
<p>
The <a href="https://viacep.com.br/">ViaCEP API</a> is a free and open Brazilian ZIP code lookup service. It provides a RESTful API that allows users to retrieve address details based on a given ZIP code. It is widely used in applications that require address information in Brazil.

For more information, refer to the [ViaCEP API documentation](https://viacep.com.br/).
