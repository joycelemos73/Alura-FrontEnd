<h2>JavaScript: Array Methods</h2>
<p>
This project demonstrates the usage of various array methods in JavaScript to manipulate and work with data.<br />
The web application showcases the implementation of these methods and provides a practical example of their usage.<br />
  
In this project, I have learned how to utilize the main array methods in JavaScript to perform various operations on arrays. These methods include forEach, map, sorting, and filtering.<br />
By understanding these methods, I gained the ability to manipulate arrays effectively and apply functions to their elements. Additionally, I learned how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using array methods, allowing for dynamic modification of web page content.<br />
