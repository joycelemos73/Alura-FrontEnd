  This is a virtual keyboard web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  The application features a grid of buttons representing keyboard keys, each of which plays a different sound when clicked or pressed on the keyboard.<br /><br />
</p>

<h3>:rocket: Getting Started</h3>
<p>
  To run the application, simply open the index.html file in a web browser.<br />
